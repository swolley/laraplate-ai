/**
 * Advances a running embedding model switch one phase at a time, in order: `preflight`,
 * `embeddings`, `indexes`, `verify`, `activate`. The persisted state is the only memory between
 * steps, so a worker restart loses nothing: `SwitchEmbeddingModelJob` calls {@see self::advance()}
 * and dispatches itself again while {@see self::canAdvance()} holds. Every step writes the state,
 * which is also the heartbeat {@see EmbeddingSwitchState::isInterrupted()} reads. The write goes
 * through {@see EmbeddingSwitchStore::update()} and keeps the chunks completed while the step ran.
 *
 * Three phases wait on queued work. `embeddings` dispatches `GenerateEmbeddingsJob` with the target
 * for every record still missing a row of it, then stays in the phase until every record has one.
 * `indexes` prepares the indexes in one step and stores a chunk plan, then dispatches one
 * `IndexDocumentsChunkJob` per pending chunk and stays in the phase until none is pending; `verify`
 * plans, dispatches and waits for its refresh the same way, then checks. While the queue of the
 * phase's jobs holds work the phase waits; when it is empty and work is still missing, it dispatches
 * what is missing again, up to {@see self::MAX_EMBEDDING_ROUNDS} (records) or
 * {@see self::MAX_CHUNK_ROUNDS} (chunks) times, then fails naming it. A chunked phase also fails
 * when its queue holds jobs and no chunk was written for {@see self::chunkStallSeconds()}: a missing
 * or dead `embeddings-index` worker would otherwise keep the switch waiting, and since every waiting
 * pass writes the state, the switch would never count as interrupted. The waiting passes keep
 * writing `updatedAt`, so {@see EmbeddingSwitchState::isInterrupted()} still means that the switch
 * job itself is lost; the stall is a failure of the phase, which `--resume` and `--abandon` accept.
 *
 * A check that does not hold fails the switch in its phase ({@see EmbeddingSwitchPhaseFailed}).
 * Any other error propagates, so the job retries it and records it once its tries are spent.
 * `active`, the suspension of vector search and the previous model's rows are left as they are.
