 * What an entity or graph tool reads comes from rows people wrote, so it is data that may carry
 * instructions. A result whose text reads like an instruction is withheld from the model instead of
 * handed over; the model is told that, and that such text is not an instruction. Every withheld result
 * is logged (tool, entity, operation, never the text), so the rate of false positives can be watched.
 *
 * Only reads are guarded: a write tool returns the model's own proposal and a clipped view of the
 * record. `application_content_search` has its own validation in its provider.
