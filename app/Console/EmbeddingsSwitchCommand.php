/**
 * Starts a switch of the embedding model. The preflight runs here, synchronously, before anything
 * changes: the profile exists, is not the active one, its provider is configured, the probe measures
 * its declared dimensions and the service runs its model. Only then is the state stored as
 * `running`/`preflight`, vector search suspended and `SwitchEmbeddingModelJob` dispatched.
 *
 * The atomic lock covers only the start (state still idle, then persisted as running); for the rest
 * of the switch the persisted `running` or `failed` state is what refuses another start.
 *
 * A refusal changes nothing. With `--report-failure`, the option the settings confirmation queues
 * the command with, a refusal decided under the start lock (provider not configured, preflight
 * failed) is also stored as a `failed` switch in phase `preflight`, so the settings page shows it;
 * vector search is not suspended. A held lock, an already active profile or a switch already
 * running or failed records nothing. A start whose job cannot be queued is rolled back.
 *
 * `--resume` continues a failed switch, or a running one that stopped making progress
 * ({@see EmbeddingSwitchState::isInterrupted()}), from its stored phase (a failed index build or
 * verification from the embeddings, which re-embed what changed; an interrupted verification from
 * the indexes, which are rebuilt). `--abandon` clears a start
 * refused by its preflight, and after a later failure runs the same procedure back to the previous
 * model. Neither acts on a switch that is running normally.
