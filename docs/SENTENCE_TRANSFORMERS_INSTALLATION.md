# Self-hosted Sentence Transformers for embeddings

Laraplate does not run Sentence Transformers inside PHP. The AI module calls a **self-hosted HTTP API** on a separate host (VM, bare metal, or container). This guide covers that sidecar service and the Laraplate configuration that points to it.

---

## What uses the embeddings provider

Embeddings are selected **per feature**, not by a global `AI_PROVIDER` variable (that env name is not read by the application).

| Config key (`ai.*`) | Purpose | Default provider id |
|---------------------|---------|---------------------|
| `features.embeddings.model` (provider of the active profile) | Search indexing (`GenerateEmbeddingsJob`), vector search, RAG chunk vectors | `sentence_transformers` |

For Sentence Transformers you only need the **embeddings** provider and its URL.

---

## Architecture

```text
[Laravel + Horizon]  --POST /embed-->  [Python host: Flask + sentence-transformers]
     .env: SENTENCE_TRANSFORMERS_URL=http://HOST:PORT
```

The Laravel application needs outbound HTTP access to the embedding host. Restrict inbound access on the embedding host to trusted clients (VPN, private network, or firewall rules).

---

## HTTP contract (required)

Laraplate expects a REST endpoint at `{base_url}/embed` (no trailing slash on the base URL).

### Single text

```http
POST /embed
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "text": "hello world",
  "truncation": true,
  "normalize_embeddings": true,
  "max_length": 512
}
```

### Batch (up to 128 texts per request)

```json
{
  "texts": ["first", "second"],
  "truncation": true,
  "normalize_embeddings": true,
  "max_length": 512,
  "model": "intfloat/multilingual-e5-small"
}
```

### Response

```json
{
  "model": "intfloat/multilingual-e5-small",
  "input_type": "passage",
  "prefix_applied": false,
  "embeddings": [[0.1, 0.2, "..."], [0.3, 0.4, "..."]]
}
```

### Input prefixes (`input_type`) and who applies them

Some models (e5, nomic, …) need a `query:` / `passage:` prefix; others (MiniLM)
need none. **Today Laraplate applies the prefix client-side** from the active
model profile (`query_prefix` / `passage_prefix` in `ai.features.embeddings`, applied by
`PrefixingEmbeddingsProvider`), so the service receives already-prefixed text and this field can be omitted.

The service **also** knows each family's convention and accepts an optional
`input_type` (`"query"` | `"passage"`). When present, it *ensures* the correct
prefix **idempotently**: if the text is already prefixed it is left untouched,
otherwise the prefix is added — so there is never a `query: query: …` double
prefix, whether the caller pre-prefixed or not. When `input_type` is omitted no
prefix is touched (current Laraplate behavior). This keeps the service safe for
other, prefix-unaware clients without changing Laraplate.

### Discovery: `GET /models`

Returns the default model, the currently resident models, and the prefix
families that support `input_type`, so a client can discover behavior instead of
hardcoding it:

```json
{
  "default_model": "intfloat/multilingual-e5-small",
  "loaded_models": ["intfloat/multilingual-e5-small"],
  "model_cache": 2,
  "input_types": ["query", "passage"],
  "prefix_families": {
    "e5": { "query": "query: ", "passage": "passage: " },
    "nomic": { "query": "search_query: ", "passage": "search_document: " }
  }
}
```

### Model selection (multi-model, request-driven)

The `model` field is **optional**. Laraplate sends the active embedding profile's service model (the part of its `provider:service_model` key in `ai.features.embeddings.models`) on every request, so the **Laravel config is the single source of truth** and the service never drifts from what the application expects. When `model` is omitted, the service uses its own `EMBEDDING_MODEL` default.

The service loads models **lazily** and keeps up to `EMBEDDING_MODEL_CACHE` of them resident (LRU), so switching the active model, or embedding with two models while a switch runs, needs no service restart. `/health` reports the default and the currently loaded models. Models of different output sizes can be served side by side: each Laraplate profile declares its own `dimensions`, and changing the model goes through `ai:embeddings:switch`, which rebuilds the indexes for the new length (see *Choose a model*).

Optional authentication: if you configure an API key on the Python service, Laraplate sends `Authorization: Bearer {key}` (env `SENTENCE_TRANSFORMERS_API_KEY`).

## Choose a port

Before starting the service, list listening ports on the **embedding host**:

```bash
ss -tlnp
# or, for one port:
ss -tlnp | grep ':8003'
sudo lsof -iTCP:8003 -sTCP:LISTEN
```

| Port | Typical use |
|------|-------------|
| 8000 | Documented default for `SENTENCE_TRANSFORMERS_URL`; often also used by `php artisan serve` |
| 8001 | Documented port of the Whisper service (`WHISPER_URL`); do not give it to the embedding service on the same host |
| 8003+ | Example when 8000–8002 are taken; pick any free port |

Use the same port in the Python process and in `SENTENCE_TRANSFORMERS_URL`.

---

## Choose a model

The vector length is declared by each embedding profile (`dimensions` in `ai.features.embeddings.models`) and is the source of truth: the RAG index is sized from the active profile, and Core's managed settings `search.vector.dimensions`, `search.vector.similarity` and `search.vector.model` are written by the model switch when it activates a profile. Do not edit them by hand (they are read-only in Settings). The two shipped profiles produce **384-dimensional** vectors.

Recommended models (384-d output):

| Hugging Face model | Dims | Notes |
|--------------------|------|-------|
| `intfloat/multilingual-e5-small` | 384 | **Default** (profile `sentence_transformers:intfloat/multilingual-e5-small`). Multilingual; requires the `query:` / `passage:` prefixes, which Laraplate adds from the model profile. |
| `sentence-transformers/paraphrase-multilingual-MiniLM-L12-v2` | 384 | Alternative multilingual model; no prefixes. Not shipped as a profile: add one (below). |
| `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2` | 384 | Lighter; English-centric; no prefixes. |

The service is **multi-model**: `EMBEDDING_MODEL` is only the default served when a request omits `model`. Keep the default equal to the active profile's `service_model` so `/health` matches what `ai:embeddings:repair` expects. To use another model, add a profile keyed `sentence_transformers:<hugging face model>`, run `php artisan ai:embeddings:probe <key>` and put the measured length in its `dimensions`, then choose it in the setting `features.embeddings.model`: the confirmation starts `ai:embeddings:switch`, which re-embeds everything, rebuilds the index mappings when the length differs, verifies and activates it. Vector search is off meanwhile. Steps and commands: [rag/MODULE.md](rag/MODULE.md), section *Embedding model and model switch*.

`max_length: 512` in the API request is the **token truncation limit** for model input, not the embedding vector size.

## Install on the embedding host (Linux)

### System packages

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y python3 python3-venv python3-pip git
```

Optional: NVIDIA driver + CUDA-compatible PyTorch for GPU inference under load.

### API server

The service code is **not duplicated here** — it lives in its own repository,
which is the single source of truth (code, pinned `requirements.txt`, systemd
unit, README):

**https://github.com/swolley/sentence-transformers-api**

Clone it on the embedding host and install from its pinned requirements:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/swolley/sentence-transformers-api.git
cd sentence-transformers-api
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

In short: the service serves any model on demand, keeps the `EMBEDDING_MODEL`
default warm, lazy-loads any other model named in a request, and keeps up to
`EMBEDDING_MODEL_CACHE` models resident (LRU). See the
[HTTP contract](#http-contract-required) below for the request/response shape
Laraplate relies on.

Model weights download from Hugging Face on first use (~hundreds of MB per model). The service downloads each requested model the first time it is asked for and caches it.

### Run manually

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
export EMBEDDING_MODEL=intfloat/multilingual-e5-small
export EMBEDDING_MODEL_CACHE=2
python sentence-api.py
```

### systemd unit (production)

The `sentence-transformers.service` unit ships with the
[service repository](https://github.com/swolley/sentence-transformers-api);
install it from there rather than copying it here.

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl restart sentence-transformers
```

Keep `EMBEDDING_MODEL` equal to the active Laraplate profile's `service_model`. On a first request for a new model the service downloads and loads it (a few seconds to a minute); subsequent requests are fast while it stays in the LRU cache.

---

## Verify the embedding host

```bash
curl -s "http://127.0.0.1:8000/health"
# {"status":"healthy","model":"intfloat/multilingual-e5-small",
#  "default_model":"intfloat/multilingual-e5-small",
#  "loaded_models":["intfloat/multilingual-e5-small"],"model_cache":2}

# Default model (dimension check — expect 384):
curl -s -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8000/embed" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"text":"hello","normalize_embeddings":true}' \
  | python3 -c "import sys,json; d=json.load(sys.stdin); print(d['model'], len(d['embeddings'][0]))"

# Explicit model (lazy-loads it, then reports it in the response and /health):
curl -s -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8000/embed" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"text":"hello","model":"sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2"}' \
  | python3 -c "import sys,json; d=json.load(sys.stdin); print(d['model'], len(d['embeddings'][0]))"
```

From the Laraplate application server, repeat the same checks against the remote IP/hostname and port.

---

## Configure Laraplate

Add or update `.env` on the Laravel host:

```env
AI_EMBEDDINGS_ENABLED=true

SENTENCE_TRANSFORMERS_URL=http://EMBEDDING_HOST:8000
SENTENCE_TRANSFORMERS_API_KEY=
```

The embedding model is chosen in the setting `features.embeddings.model`; the one that serves search is Core's managed setting `search.vector.model` (seeded with `sentence_transformers:intfloat/multilingual-e5-small`), which only a model switch changes. Neither is an env var. Laraplate sends the profile's service model (the part of the key after the provider) to the service per request. Keep the service's `EMBEDDING_MODEL` default equal to the active one.

Notes:

- The `sentence_transformers` profiles are offered only when `SENTENCE_TRANSFORMERS_URL` is set.
- Chat, translation and every other AI feature choose their model in Filament > Settings (`features.*.model`), not in env; see `rag/AI_MODEL_SELECTION_USER.md`.

Core's vector settings follow the active profile and need no edit. Enable Scout/vector search as in [SEARCH_AND_TRANSLATION.md](SEARCH_AND_TRANSLATION.md).

---

## After go-live

### Queue workers

Embedding generation uses `GenerateEmbeddingsJob`. Horizon or `queue:work` must run on the Laraplate host.

### Backfill existing content

```bash
php artisan ai:embeddings:repair "Modules\\CMS\\Models\\Content"
```

Replace the FQCN with each searchable model that defines `$embed`.

A model switch rebuilds the Elasticsearch documentation indexes itself. With a `filesystem` or `memory` documentation store, run `php artisan ai:index-rag-docs --full` after the switch.

---

## Optional: cross-encoder reranker

Hybrid search can rerank its top results with a cross-encoder through `POST {url}/score`. `CROSS_ENCODER_URL` is the base URL of that service (the client adds `/score`) and, when it is not set, `SENTENCE_TRANSFORMERS_URL` is used: the `sentence-api` service (repository `laraplate-sentencetransformer`) serves `/score` next to `/embed` with its default model (`CROSS_ENCODER_MODEL` on its host changes it, and an empty value turns it off). The key is `CROSS_ENCODER_API_KEY`, falling back to `SENTENCE_TRANSFORMERS_API_KEY`. There is no built-in address: with no URL, or a service whose model is turned off (it answers 503), nothing is reranked. Not required for embeddings; if the service is down, or answers with anything but one numeric score per pair, search returns unreranked results (`meta.reranked = false`, a warning in the log). The evaluation commands (`ai:evaluate-retrieval-strategies`, `ai:tune-retrieval`) warn when it did not run, because their `reranked` figures are then the fused order. While no service answers `/score`, `search.reranker.enabled` can be turned off so that each search does not spend a failed call and a warning on it.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause |
|---------|----------------|
| Connection refused from Laravel | Wrong URL/port, firewall, or service not listening on `0.0.0.0` |
| HTTP 401 | `SENTENCE_TRANSFORMERS_API_KEY` mismatch with Python `API_KEY` |
| Vector search off, `meta.vector_disabled` = `dimension_mismatch` | The index `dense_vector` dims differ from `search.vector.dimensions`; finish or resume the switch (`ai:embeddings:status`) |
| Keyword-only search documents | Embeddings job failed; check Horizon; run `ai:embeddings:repair` |
| `Embeddings count mismatch` | API returned fewer vectors than texts |
